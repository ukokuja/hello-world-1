            Set in Albuquerque, New Mexico, between 2008 and 2010,[12] Breaking Bad follows Walter White,
            a meek high school science teacher who transforms into a ruthless player in the local methamphetamine drug trade,
            driven by a desire to provide for his family after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.
            Initially making only small batches of meth with his former student Jesse Pinkman in a rolling meth lab,
            Walter and Jesse eventually expand to make larger batches of a special blue meth that is incredibly pure and creates high demand.

                Jesse, you asked me if I was in the meth business, or the money business… Neither. I’m in the empire business.
